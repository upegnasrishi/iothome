## IoT Home Automation Project
Welcome to the IoT Home Automation project repository! This project aims to create a smart home environment by integrating various components for convenience and security. The project includes the following features:

## Components
1. Doorbell with Proximity Sensor
The doorbell component utilizes a proximity sensor to detect hand gestures. When a hand is waved near the sensor, the doorbell rings, providing a touchless and interactive experience for visitors.

2. Automated Password-Protected Door
The automated door system is equipped with a secure password mechanism. It enables authorized users to unlock the door using a password. This feature enhances the security and access control of your home.

3. Sensor-Based LED Light
The sensor-based LED light automatically turns on when it detects low light conditions, such as during the night or in a dark room. This energy-efficient feature ensures adequate illumination when needed.

4. Sensor-Based Ceiling Fan
The sensor-based ceiling fan is designed to provide comfort by automatically turning on when the humidity level rises. This feature maintains optimal humidity and airflow levels in the room.
